# Design-Patterns-in-TypeScript 

## Project is a WIP
At the moment this project is still a WIP as I am learning these design patterns in my free-time outside of work. Eventually I plan on having the 23 design patterns discussed in the [Gang of Four Design Patterns book](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8). 

## Purpose of this Project
The past few months I have been going down the JavaScript rabbit hole and enjoying it. However, I've always wished JavaScript was a statically typed language. When I first started programming I used statically typed langauges (Java, C++, C, C#) and got used to defining the data-type. It was something I also used to help write code with less errors and that was easier to read (for me). I like knowing what data-type is going to be stored in a variable, get passed into a function, and so on. So I setup TypeScript on my computer. I've been loving it so far. I can do everything I can do in JavaScript and define my data-types, it is a bit more verbose when it comes to the code but I am happy with the trade-off. 

As for Design Patterns, this is something that I have been wanting to learn about recently. So I bought the Gang of Four book about Design Patterns but for a first time reader that book is alot to take in, so I have also found some helpful youtube series to help me learn these various design patterns. I am excited to learn about Design Patterns as I am trying to improve my Software Engineering skills and this is something that I think can help a lot. I plan on creating simple implementations of all of the design patterns discussed in the Gang of Four Design Patterns book along with a brief description of it and any other resources and references that are revelant.

## Just a Quick Heads-Up

The explanations for the design patterns should not be taken as gospel as these are things I'm learning. They're merely for the purpose of my learning experience and trying to describe these design patterns in my own words to show I have an understanding of them and not just have some copy and pasted definition for each design pattern. So if you somehow stumbled upon this repo to learn about Design Patterns in TypeScript (or any language) then I would recommend looking at the Helpful Resources section. 

If you see any errors please let me know so I can fix it.
