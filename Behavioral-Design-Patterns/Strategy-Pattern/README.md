# Strategy Pattern (WIP)

## What is the Strategy Pattern?

## Example

Below is the UML the code for this implementation was inspired by. The main difference is the sort algorithms used. They used Merge Sort and Quick Sort. For the sake of implementating different algorithms in a simple manner I used Bubble Sort and No Sort (just a console.log saying no sorting algorithm was used).
