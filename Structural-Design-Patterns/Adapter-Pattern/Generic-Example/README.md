## How to Run the Code

Instructions

Step 0: Install node if you do not have it. If you have it installed already, then skip this. I also recommend installing an IDE (ex. VS Code) but any text editor will work.

Step 1: Open your terminal

Step 2: Go into the "Design-Patterns-in-TypeScript/Structural-Design-Patterns/Adapter-Pattern/Generic-Example" directory on your local machine.

Step 3: Run the node main.js command in your terminal

When you run the code you will see the result below

![Capture --- Generic Adapter](https://github.com/Hagnap/Design-Patterns-in-TypeScript/assets/60297426/2c63361d-49a7-4ffe-8e92-0acbc5474b21)

The first line of output comes from an instance of Target and the second comes from an istance of Adapter.
