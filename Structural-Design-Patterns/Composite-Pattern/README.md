## How to Run the Code

Instructions

Step 0: Install node if you do not have it. If you have it installed already, then skip this. I also recommend installing an IDE (ex. VS Code) but any text editor will work.

Step 1: Open your terminal

Step 2: Go into the "Design-Patterns-in-TypeScript/Structural-Design-Patterns/Composite-Pattern" directory on your local machine.

Step 3: Run the node main.js command in your terminal

Below is a result of the code being run. All it does is inspect files and directories/folders. If it's a file you will see the name of the file, if it's a directory/folder then you will see the files that it stores.
